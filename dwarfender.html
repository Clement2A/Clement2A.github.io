        <p>This is the first big Unreal project I got to work on at Objectif3D, alongside other students after having learned about the engine for about 2 months. After the game designers had made a prototype using Blueprints, we've worked for 3 months on it to make it as complete as possible</p>
        <p>
            I've worked on quite a few elements in this project:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The tutorial gamemode, alongside all prompts reacting the the player's action</li>
                <li>All world widgets, like the enemy health bars, the animated popup when an enemy is destroyed and the notifications when you first build a trap or a tower</li>
                <li>The navgrid system, calculating a path for the enemies with A*, alongside a tool to easily generate the grid on the level and modify it</li>
                <li>The building sytem, how the preview of a building snaps onto the grid, switching which building to build and changing its material depending on wether the player has enough resources for it.</li>
                <li>Some UI elements, like the player's health bar, the building selection widget and the crosshair</li>
            </ul>
