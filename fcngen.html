        <p>This is quite an old code I had done while still doing my fullstack web dev master. Using already existing city names, and dividing them by phonemes. I ended up with many syllables that when randomly put together, alongside some prefixes and suffixes, you end up getting some fairly believable french-sounding city names. I also added a few extra checks, to avoid cases like double vowels, or remove a consonent when 2 syllables starting and ending with one fuses.</p>
